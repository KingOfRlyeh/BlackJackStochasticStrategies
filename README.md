# BlackJackStochasticStrategies
A playground for testing playing and betting strategies for blackjack. Feels a bit like searching for the philosopher's stone. Don't Gamble!

I made this because I gained a casual interest in card counting and wanted to assure myself that I wasn't wasting my time first. One can see from the results that it would in fact be wasing one's time.

Goals
---
I suppose I'm trying to shore-up my computational methods skills as well as teach myself the general mechanics of Monte-Carlo methods. I'm also looking to see if I can creatively think of some methods for winning over many many trials. I'm not sure if I should be focusing on strategies that can be done by a _human_... after all, I'm a computational scientist.

Issues
---
- I think perhaps my matrix strategy isn't optimized for the settings of the game right now! Perhaps I need a way to produce the betting table generatively.
- I need to research other card counting strategies

I probably won't develop this anymore. It was just a fun little project.
